# -Leukemia-Blood-Cancer-Detection-on-Blood-Smear-Based-on-Microscopic-Image-Using-Deep-Neural-Net


# 1.1 Objectives of project:

The main objective is to build a neural network that can classify human blood smear image and
identify the status (diagnosis) of cell where it is normal or it is a leukemia cell, where human
blood is the main source to detect diseases at earlier stage and can prevent it quickly, the system
can be automated in order to produce lab results quickly, easily and efficiently.

# 1.2 Introduction

Medical imaging has become one of the most important visualization and interpretation methods
in biology and medicine over the past decade. This time has witnessed a tremendous
development of new, powerful instruments for detecting, storing, transmitting, analyzing, and
displaying medical images. This has led to a huge growth in the application of digital image
processing techniques for solving medical problems [1].
The most challenging aspect of medical imaging lies in the development of integrated systems
for the use of the clinical sector. Design, implementation, and validation of complex medical
systems require a tight interdisciplinary collaboration between physicians and engineers. Main
objective of analyzing through images is to gather information, detection of diseases, diagnosis
diseases, control and therapy, monitoring and evaluation [2]. At the moment, identification of
blood disorders is done through visual inspection of microscopic images of blood cells. From the
identification of blood disorders, classification of certain diseases could be reached.
Leukemia is a type of cancer affecting blood, and if it is detected late, it will result in death.
Leukemia occurs when a lot of abnormal white blood cells are produced by bone marrow. When
abnormal white blood cells are a lot, the balance of the blood system will be disrupted. The
existence of abnormal blood can be detected when the blood sample is taken and examined by
hematologists.

# 1.3 Problem definition

Microscopic images will be inspected visually by hematologists and the process is time
consuming and tiring [3 - 5]. The process require human expert and prone to errors due to
emotion disturbance and human physical capability that is of course have its own limit.
Moreover, it is difficult to get consistent results from visual inspection [3].
Visual inspection also can only give qualitative results for further research [3]. Studies show that
most of the recent techniques use all information about blood for e.g. number of red blood cells,
hemoglobin level, hematocrit level, mean volume corpuscle and many more as the parameter for
classifying diseases such as thalassaemia, cancer and etc.
In order to know all information about blood, expensive testing and equipment of labs are
required. Automatic image processing system is urgently needed and can overcome related
constraints in visual inspection. The system to be developed will be based on microscopic

images to recognize leukemia cell in blood smear. The early and fast identification of the
leukemia type greatly aids in providing the appropriate treatment for particular type of leukemia
[6]. The currently used diagnostic methods rely on analyzing immunophenotyping, fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH), cytogenetic analysis and cytochemistry. Sophisticated and
expensive laboratories are required in order to run the diagnostic methods and it have been
reported to provide a high ratio of misidentification, with this system, more images can be
processed, reduce analyzing time, exclude the influence of subjective factors and increase the
accuracy of identification process at the same time.
 In machine learning the inspection and classification of leukemia will be based on texture,
shape, size, color, and statistical analysis of white blood cells while deep learning makes it much
deeper and get the whole features in the image as we will discuss this in latter chapters.
This project is applied to increase efficiency globally and at the same time can benefit and be a
huge contribution in medical and pattern recognition field. The main objective is to enhance
algorithms that can extract data from human blood where human blood is the main source to
detect diseases at earlier stage and can prevent it quickly [8]. This system should be robust
towards diversity that exists among individual, sample collection protocols, time and etc. this is
an automated system that can produce lab results quickly, easily and efficiently.
